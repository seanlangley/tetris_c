# tetris_c

To build the game, you first need to install the ncurses graphics library. How to do this depends on your host machine.
The following works on Debian-based Linux distrobutions: `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`.

Then, you can build the game with the command `make`.

To run the game, you can run `./bin/tetris`.
